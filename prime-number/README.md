# Prime Number

- prime numbers are positive integers greater than `1` with exactly two factors, `1` and `the number itself`.
- Always remember that `1 is neither prime nor composite`.
- All prime numbers are odd numbers except 2, `2 is the smallest prime number and is the only even prime number`.
- Every prime number can be represented in the form of `6n + 1` or `6n â€“ 1` except the prime numbers `2 and 3`, where n is a natural number.
- Two and Three are only two consecutive natural numbers that are prime.
